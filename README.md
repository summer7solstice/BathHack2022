Cavity Detector based on Ardunio and iOS
Plz refer to https://bathhack.bcss.website/

Our application aims to detect any hollow in objects. It uses Ardunio and its sensors, calculating the exact distance from the surface of objects to the front surface of the hollow inside. The calculating code is written in C++, then data would be sent to our app "Cavity Kevin" through bluetooth, the data displaying stuff is as following UI design.
